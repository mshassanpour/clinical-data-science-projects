# Projects Included
1. Cigarette Consumption vs. Diabetes Prevalence
Objective: To explore the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the prevalence of diabetes.
Description: This project involves loading, cleaning, and analyzing relational clinical data. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand how smoking habits correlate with diabetes rates. Various visualizations and statistical methods are employed to uncover patterns and insights.

2. Breast Cancer Tumor Classification
Objective: To train a model that can predict whether breast cancer tumors are malignant or benign based on tumor characteristics.
Description: Utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, this project focuses on feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Several machine learning algorithms are compared to determine the best performing model for accurate classification.

3. Ophthalmology Image Segmentation
Objective: To develop a segmentation algorithm for detecting blood vessels in ophthalmology images.
Description: This project uses image processing techniques to segment blood vessels from retinal images. The methods involve preprocessing, applying segmentation algorithms, and evaluating the results to improve accuracy and reliability.

4. Hospital Readmission Forecasting
Objective: To train a model that identifies patients at risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.
Description: By analyzing patient discharge data, this project aims to predict readmission risks to enhance patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Various features are extracted from the data, and different machine learning models are tested to find the most effective predictor.
