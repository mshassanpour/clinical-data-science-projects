# Projects Included
### 1. SmokingDiabetes Database Ops
- **Objective:** To explore the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the prevalence of diabetes using SQL and Python for database management and analysis.
- **Description:** This project involves generating a database from CSV files and performing exploratory data analysis using SQL and Python. The aim is to uncover patterns and insights into how smoking habits correlate with diabetes rates.
- **Path:** notebooks/smoking_diabetes_database_ops.ipynb
### 2. Cigarette Consumption vs. Diabetes Prevalence
- **Objective:** To explore the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the prevalence of diabetes.
- **Description:** This project involves loading, cleaning, and analyzing relational clinical data. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand how smoking habits correlate with diabetes rates. Various visualizations and statistical methods are employed to uncover patterns and insights.

### 3. Breast Cancer Tumor Classification
- **Objective:** To train a model that can predict whether breast cancer tumors are malignant or benign based on tumor characteristics.
- **Description:**  Utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, this project focuses on feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Several machine learning algorithms are compared to determine the best performing model for accurate classification.

### 4. Ophthalmology Image Segmentation
- **Objective:**  To develop a segmentation algorithm for detecting blood vessels in ophthalmology images.
- **Description:** This project uses image processing techniques to segment blood vessels from retinal images. The methods involve preprocessing, applying segmentation algorithms, and evaluating the results to improve accuracy and reliability.
- **Path:** notebooks/ophthalmology_segmentation.ipynb
### 5. Hospital Readmission Forecasting
- **Objective:**  To train a model that identifies patients at risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.
- **Description:** By analyzing patient discharge data, this project aims to predict readmission risks to enhance patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Various features are extracted from the data, and different machine learning models are tested to find the most effective predictor.
